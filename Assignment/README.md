Math.C Readme

Math.C when compiled and ran is a basic calculator program.

It will prompt the user to enter a function of their choice, and then it will prompt the user to enter 2 numbers.
When the user does this the program will return a value.

For example if the user chooses addition and enters + and chooses the numbers 1 and 2,the program will return "1 + 2 = 3".

The program can do the following functions:
"+" Add (num1 + num2)

"-" Subtract (num1 - num2)

"*" Multiply (num1 * num2)

"/" Divide (num1 / num2)

"%" Modulus (num1 % num2)

"<" Left Shift (num1 << num2)

">" Right Shift (num1 >> num2)

"&" Bitwise AND (num1 & num2)

"|" Bitwise OR (num1 | num2)

"^" Bitwise XOR (num1 ^ num2)

"~" Bitwise Inverse (~num1)


The program exits after the operation the user has chose for numbers 1 and 2 is completed.
